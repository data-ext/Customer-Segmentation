# Customer-Segmentation
**Customer Segmentation and High-Value Customer Identification**

**What the Project Does**
This project leverages the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to segment customers and identify high-value customers. By analyzing customer purchase behavior, the RFM model categorizes customers based on their recent interactions, purchase frequency, and total spending. This segmentation helps businesses target high-value customers more effectively and optimize marketing strategies.

**Why the Project is Useful**
Understanding customer segments and identifying high-value customers can significantly enhance targeted marketing efforts, improve customer retention, and increase revenue. This project provides actionable insights into customer behavior, allowing businesses to focus resources on the most profitable segments and tailor strategies to meet their needs.
